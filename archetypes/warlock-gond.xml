            <p>Gond looks favorably upon you and wishes to bestow you a gift. You receive a wolf-shaped automaton, which is about 3 feet tall at the shoulder. Has the ability to follow simple instructions, and has a built in saddle as well as a few small storage compartments. When not in use, it magically compacts into a small cube, roughly 4 inches in diameter with an incantation written on the top, "Bractha Fi Harog A Gond," or "Awaken, you Wolf of Gond." To shutdown, use the incantation "Hûm Fi Harog A Gond," or "Sleep, you Wolf of Gond."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent">Gond tells you that as long as he is still pleased with your work, more gifts shall be given.</p>
