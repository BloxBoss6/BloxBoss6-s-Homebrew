            <p>Gond looks favorably upon you and wishes to bestow you a gift. You receive a wolf-shaped automaton, which is about 3 feet tall at the shoulder. Has the ability to follow simple instructions, and has a built in saddle as well as a few small storage compartments. When not in use, it magically compacts into a small cube, roughly 4 inches in diameter with an incantation written on the top, "Bractha Fi Harog A Gond," or "Awaken, you Wolf of Gond." To shutdown, use the incantation "Hûm Fi Harog A Gond," or "Sleep, you Wolf of Gond."</p>
            <p></p>
            <p class="indent">Gond tells you that as long as he is still pleased with your work, more gifts shall be given.</p>

			<description>The beast obeys your commands as best as it can. It takes its turn on your initiative, though it doesn’t take an action unless you command it to. On your turn, you can verbally command the beast where to move. You can use your action to verbally command it to take the Attack, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, or Help action. Once you have the Extra Attack feature, you can make one weapon attack yourself when you command the beast to take the Attack action.
			While traveling through your favored terrain with only the beast, you can move stealthily at a normal pace.
			If the beast dies, you can obtain another one by spending 8 hours magically bonding with another beast that isn’t hostile to you, either the same type of beast as before or a different one.</description>

			<p>You can use your action to create a pact weapon in your empty hand. You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it. You are proficient with it while you wield it. This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your pact weapon disappears if it is more than 5 feet away from you for 1 minute or more. It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon. You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest. You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter. You can’t affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in this way. The weapon ceases being your pact weapon if you die, if you perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon, or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it. The weapon appears at your feet if it is in the extradimensional space when the bond breaks.</p>
